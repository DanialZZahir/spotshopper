<h1>Day 1</h1>
To start off this react project I compartmentalized my root folder into two folders, ./client/ and ./server/

then I cd into the client subdirectory and executed the following command:
```git
npx create-react-app
```
this generated the files for a basic react web app template, ready to edit and view if a development server in the browser.
